# Martian-Harmony-Python-work

In this project , we take a sheet and provide the coordinates for every note in the sheet. Now we identify the position of all scales and their cooresponding notes on the horizontal scale using the horizontal lines on images. Then to identify the notes to be played we remove all the noise(horizontal and vertical lines) and keep only the notes(The dots). Now we have the notes(using y coordinate) and the time they are to be played(using the x coordinate). We provide this information to instruments and they play the notes correspondingly.
